# Grep-command-python-program
This is a modified version of the grep command written in python.
This program will find a word across three files and print the file name, the line on which the word was found on, 
the contents of that line, and the number of lines matched.
It is also worth noting that it is case insensitive therefore "HELLO" and "hello" would be considered a match.
